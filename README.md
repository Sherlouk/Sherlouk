## Hello 👋🏼 👨🏼‍💻

Hi, I'm James Sherlock! I'm an iOS developer who primarily focusses on Swift and iOS but loves to explore the rest of the Apple ecosystem. I'm passionate about open-source, accessibility and automation!

I'm always looking at opportunities to widen my knowledge, whether that be web development or struggling with seemingly simple Heroku setups 👀

Currently, I work on the [Sky News iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sky-news-breaking-uk-world/id316391924) supporting breaking news for millions of brits every day 🙌
