## Hello 👋🏼 👨🏼‍💻

I'm James Sherlock! I'm a principal mobile engineer specialising in Swift and iOS, though I also love exploring the rest of Apple's ecosystem. I'm passionate about open-source, accessibility and automation!

I'm always looking at opportunities to widen my knowledge, whether that be web development, android apps or just struggling with seemingly simple Heroku setups 👀

Currently, I help lead the [Sky Sports iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/sky-sports/id500102120) supporting breaking news and major sporting events for millions of users every day 🙌

I'm also an indie developer over at [@GetSidetrack](https://github.com/getsidetrack/)
